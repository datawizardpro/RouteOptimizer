Features
Route Optimization: Leverages advanced algorithms to calculate the most efficient routes, minimizing travel time and fuel costs.

Real-Time Visualization: Interactive maps and dashboards to monitor routes and operational performance.

KPI Tracking: Customizable metrics (e.g., delivery time, cost per route, vehicle utilization) to assess and improve efficiency.

Scalable Design: Suitable for small businesses and large enterprises alike.

Data Integration: Supports input from various sources (e.g., CSV, API) for seamless operational data management.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Git

Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)

Steps
Clone the Repository
bash

git clone https://github.com/datawizardpro/RouteOptimizer.git
cd RouteOptimizer

Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)
bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install Dependencies
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure Environment
Rename .env.example to .env and update the variables (see Configuration (#configuration)).

Run the Application
bash

python main.py

Usage
RouteOptimizer can be used via the command line or integrated into existing workflows. Below is a basic example:
bash

python main.py --input data/sample_routes.csv --output optimized_routes.csv

Input: Provide a CSV file with columns such as start_location, end_location, distance, and priority.

Output: Generates an optimized route plan with visualized results and KPI reports.

For detailed options, run:
bash

python main.py --help

Example Workflow
Import your route data.

Run the optimization algorithm.

View the results on an interactive dashboard or export them for reporting.
